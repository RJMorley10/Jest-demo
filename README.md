Scenario: 
In the height of the COVID-19 pandemic toilet paper is now worth more than gold, there are shortages that are lasting weeks. On top of that anytime stores get it there are hoards of people waiting to buy 
more to supplement their already massive stockpiles. As a smart and concious shopper only buy what you need the issue is that when the store gets toilet paper it is always gone before you can get there. Each morning a stocker at your local grocery store posts a list of all the items they stocked the night before. You make a deal with this stocker so that they will post a seemingly random item in the list and that is their message to you that they have toilet paper giving you a head start in the quest for TP. 

Your Intern copys each post into an array for you and even wrote you a function to check if the store has stocked toilet paper. The issue now is after several days of inconsistent results you begin to question your interns work. They have set up one jest test that succeeds but that is far from enough, use your knowledge of jest to write more tests to test out this function and figure out what is going wrong.
